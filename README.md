### ES6-OOP

# Many object-oriented patterns emerged in the ES5 version of JavaScript, but now in ES6 we have a new syntax to create classes and objects.

# I'll be coding classes for many different types of objects. Classes for regular business objects, classes which can be extended, used for inheritance, a data service class to hold all of the application's data, user interface classes, and I'll create a class to hold an entire web application.

1. Run `npm start` to start the parcel server on port 1111 (you can pass `--port ${PORT-NUMBER}` to run on a different port.
